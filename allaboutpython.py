#THIS IS A COMPREHENSIVE LESSON ON PYTHON 
#AUTHORED BY NEVILLE NGONIDZASHE NYAMHINDU 

#WE ARE GOING TO LEARN EVERYTHING ABOUT VARIABLES
#Let's define first what a variable is.
#A variable is a container that holds data and stores the information in the computer's memory space.
#What follows is the example of a variable:

a = 2 

#(a) is  a variable that holds data and stores the information in the computer's memory space
#  
#the (=) is called an assigner, it signs value to the variable
#(2) is the assigned value. 

#THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS OF WRITING A VARIABLE.
#MULTIPLE ASSIGNMENT OR TUPLE UNPACKING
a,b,c = 1, 2, 3 
a=b=c = 1, 2, 3 
print(a, b, c)
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
del a,b,c #deletes the variables 

#TUPLE UNPACKING IS A SMART WAY OF AVOIDING THIS:
a = 1 
b = 2 
c = 3 
#THE FIRST WAY OF WRITING VARIABLES SAVES TIME (LINE 16 - 17)

#ALSO VARIABLES ARE WRITTEN FOLLOWING A PYTHON SYNTAX i.e 
#camelCase
#snake_case
#camelCase = nameSurname
#snake_case = name_surname
#THESE ARE THE EXPECTED WAYS TO WRITE PYTHON VARIABLES
